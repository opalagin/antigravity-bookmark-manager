High-level Idea (HLI) 

When I read an article (web page) I want to bookmark it. Later I want to ask my Bookmark Manager if there are articles on the desired theme. For example, I read an article about creating REST controller in Sprint Boot and then "bookmarked" it. Time passed, I am opening my Smart Bookmark Manager and ask it "Do I have any articles about creating REST controllers in Sprint Boot?" And it spits out the list of bookmarked articles. I can go directly to the article by clicking the link, but I can also continue chatting with it. For example, I can ask to show me latest example how to create a controller. 

 

Dissection of HLI 

    That smart interaction will require AI like LLM 

    We need to "infer" article and its metadata somewhere so AI can find it 

    "Finding" article require some Search Index / Engine and has to be AI-capable (at least AI can easily work with it) 

    Browser plugin is required to perform bookmarking and whatever is required to process the article for future usage 

    There is also some back-end involved which will run AI, run Search, retain articles (or their summary or anything more compatible with AI?) 

 
 High-Level Technical Validation 

Your technical hints are spot on. To build this, your stack would likely look like this: 

Component 
	

Technology (Industry Standard 2026) 

Ingestion 
	

Browser Extension (Manifest V3) + Web Scraper (to clean HTML into Markdown). 

Storage 
	

Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or pgvector) to store "embeddings" of the text. 

Search 
	

Hybrid Search: Combining Keyword Search (BM25) with Semantic Search (Vector) for better accuracy. 

Intelligence 
	

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): The AI doesn't just "know" things; it retrieves your bookmark and feeds it to the LLM as context for the answer.
